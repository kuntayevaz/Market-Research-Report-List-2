<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laminating Epoxy Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity</li><li>High Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laminating epoxy resins market can be classified into two types â€“ low viscosity and high viscosity. Low viscosity epoxy resins have a thinner consistency, enabling easy penetration into the fibers and ensuring good wetting characteristics. These resins are ideal for applications requiring a strong bond and excellent mechanical properties. On the other hand, high viscosity epoxy resins are thicker and more suitable for applications that need gap filling and higher build-up properties. Both types offer different advantages based on the specific requirements of laminating projects.</p></p>
