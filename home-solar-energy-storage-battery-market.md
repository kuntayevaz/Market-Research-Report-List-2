<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Home Solar Energy Storage Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Coupled Solar Battery</li><li>DC-Coupled Solar Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AC-coupled solar battery market refers to the systems where the solar panels generate DC electricity, which is then converted into AC electricity using an inverter. This AC electricity is used to power the home, and any excess energy is stored in a battery for later use. On the other hand, DC-coupled solar battery systems directly connect the solar panels to the battery, without the need for an inverter. These systems are capable of storing and using DC electricity directly from the solar panels.</p></p>
