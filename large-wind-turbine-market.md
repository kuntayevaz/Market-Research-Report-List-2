<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The large wind turbine market can be categorized into two main types: horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) and vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). The HAWT is the more common type, featuring blades that rotate horizontally, parallel to the ground. It utilizes the wind's kinetic energy to generate electricity. On the other hand, the VAWT has blades that rotate vertically around a central axis. It is designed to capture wind energy from any direction, making it more suitable for urban environments. Both types contribute to the renewable energy sector by harnessing wind power for electricity generation.</p></p>
