<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Pump Dehumidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tower Type</li><li>Rotor Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The heat pump dehumidifier market consists of two main types: tower type and rotor type. Tower type dehumidifiers are tall and slim, resembling a tower, and are commonly used in large spaces or industrial settings. They use a fan to draw in air, which passes through cooling and heating coils to remove moisture. Rotor type dehumidifiers, on the other hand, use a rotating wheel made of desiccant material to absorb moisture from the air. This wheel is then heated to release the collected moisture. Both types are effective in reducing humidity levels but are suitable for different applications.</p></p>
