<p><strong>The Internal Roof Insulation Materials Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Roof</li><li>Pitched Roof</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Internal roof insulation materials are used in both flat roof and pitched roof applications. In a flat roof market, these materials are used to create a thermal barrier between the interior of a building and the roof, preventing heat loss and reducing energy consumption. In a pitched roof market, these materials are used to insulate between the rafters, keeping the interior of the building comfortable and reducing the need for heating or cooling. Both markets aim to improve energy efficiency and provide a more comfortable living or working environment.</p></p>
