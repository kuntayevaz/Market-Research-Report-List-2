<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Level Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Differential Pressure Switch</li><li>Static Pressure Switch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Diaphragm Level Switch market encompasses two main types, namely Differential Pressure Switch and Static Pressure Switch. A Differential Pressure Switch utilizes the pressure difference between two points in a system to detect the liquid level. It is commonly used in applications where accuracy and specific measurements are required. On the other hand, a Static Pressure Switch operates by maintaining a constant pressure at a specified level, making it suitable for applications where a consistent level is necessary. Both types cater to different industry needs with respect to liquid level control.</p></p>
